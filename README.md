# Blockify - A Spotify Ad Blocker for Chrome

Shuts up annoying Spotify ads for a less jarring listening experience. Plays soft filler music until ads are over.

3. Now you'll see Blockify. Make sure it is active. That's all! It will work automatically when you listen to music on [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com/)

### Add to Firefox

1. In Firefox, go to url: `about:debugging`
2. On the left sidebar, click "This Firefox" to manage extensions
3. "Load Temporary Add-on...", navigate to blockify folder on your computer

NOTE: Extensions loaded this way are only installed temporarily. They will be removed once Firefox is closed. Sorry, working on distributing

### How do I hush the filler music???

Blockify plays random filler music while Spotify Ads play.

You can stop the background music at any time with the audio controller that appears in the upper right of Chrome.

In Firefox... I dunno.
